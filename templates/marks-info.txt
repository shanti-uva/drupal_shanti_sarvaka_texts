LAYOUT WRAPPERS*​

FIRST - What is this new content wrapper class doing? - ​_bootstrap-threecol-stacked_​

The new Panel wrapper classes for content/sidebar are shown below with the equivelant Sarvaka class structure. Replace the bootstrap class in the PANELS wrapper with the Sarvaka BS classes, and add the other classes/ID for content-section and sidebar as shown.

CLASS = ​*panel-panel middle col-lg-9*​
CLASS = ​*content-section col-xs-12 col-md-9 equal-height*​

ID = ​*none*​ / CLASS = ​*panel-panel right col-sm-3*​
ID = ​*sidebar-second*​ / CLASS = ​*region sidebar sidebar-second pull-right sidebar-offcanvas col-xs-6 col-md-3 equal-height*​

----------
​*IMAGES*​

The main fix here is the Bootstrap system for images uses the CLASS =​* img-thumbnail*​ on the image element, not the wrapper as it is now in the panels templates.

-----------
​*HEADERS*​

Based on what I"ve seen so far, I prefer a standard of all <h2> headers in the content-section and <h3> in the sidebar.

---------------
​*FONT FORMAT*​

For ​*italics*​, use the <em> tags as wrappers, not the <i> tags I'm finding on Collections-Sources page below:

​*SIDEBAR LISTS*​
​*Question:*​ I prefer only the header to have an Icon, not each list item. Is there s strong preference among you for icons on each list item? (edited)

[7:31] 
​*Question:*​ Relatedly, where and how to use the icon for people, We have Team Members & Owner, but perhaps only Team Members should get an Icon...? (edited)

[7:31] 
​*Question:*​  Are there any other common lists planned for this sidebar? (edited)

[7:35] 
​*Question:*​  In the Panels sidebar the big buttons for Adding Subcollection, Audio, Video - These are not using the sidebar button model Audio-Video has uesd in the past (Convoy Mockup) and is still on the AV-Homepage. This should probably be standardized for the panels sidebar buttons as well. (edited)

@markferrara: "bootstrap-threecol-stacked" is from the bootstrap layouts module. Some settings can be customized but not sure if that can be worked into the feature or not. No preference on the icons in a list for me. Brad suggested that we conflate Members and Owners and just put "(owner)" next to the owner's name, but I'm not sure how simple that would be and would be down the road. But both are people so should have the icon, no? Add buttons are done through a template in the subtheme in the templates folder. This should probably be moved to the base theme so you can standardize the markup and just do it once. Lists in side column are just buttons, owner, members, parent collection or subcollection list. Nothing else planned for now but who knows!

Mark Ferrara [8:43 AM] 
Okay @thangrove votes, please respond and confirm Than
​*SIDEBARS*​
- Icons only on sidebar headers not each list item. Mark can add the icons on headers via CSS if the extra icon HTML is difficult to incorporate into the template for sidebar headers.
- Collection Owner needs better solution
- The ​*bootstrap-threecol-stacked*​ is default from module. (Is the module really needed for developing the layouts mark asks...?)
- Follow-up QUESTION - Can the Sarvaka wrapper classes be added to integrate the page layouts with Sarvaka...? (edited)

Mark Ferrara [1:16 PM] 
@thangrove: @raf - This would be hugely useful to eliminating a lot of CSS - ​_Can you add a class to the Body tag for all page receiving the new panels layout?_​ So far I'm finding all these avarious flavors of Collections pages have different classes on the body tag.

[1:18] 
• Similar topic, I'm still reviewing the various ​_Admin-edit pages_​ but am still uncertain how to approach this best with target classes/selectors, but will get back to you with a suggestion later today

[1:21] 
•• And how necessary is it to use the Boostrap Layout module to create these templates? IS it really that helpful? THe video tutorial made it look painful to create a layout, not to mention limiting, and since we just have esentially one page model, or a couple, it seems ​_silly_​ from my perspective. And another module to maintain. Is it just an experiment? (edited)

Mark Ferrara [1:35 PM] 
FYI - CLASS= ​*og-context*​ is what I'm adopting (testing) for  a universal selector to target the Collections template. I don't know it is or what it does, but seems associated with this template... anyone care to clarify/confirm this?

[1:37] 
• Oh well, it seems ​*og-context*​ is not the answer, since I"m finding across other pages now... Any help on this issue of a universal class for the Panels template is welcome.

Mark Ferrara [2:12 PM] 
@thangrove: Another Collections template conflict - ​*panel-panel middle col-lg-9*​ is in Sources, but in AV the same column is ​*panel-panel left col-sm-9*​

[2:12] 
• I prefer this stays as ​*middle*​ since the left may be needed somewhere, if not in Mandala, another website. It's already throwing things off since I do not have ​*content-section*​ either added (yet) to this column wrapper, and the bootstrap class is not right and will soon be changed. (edited)

[2:16] 
Also Note Than: ​*<div class="bootstrap-twocol-stacked" id="shanti-texts-collection">*​  is in the AV App, but that ID belongs in Texts App - it appears.

- - AND BELOW IS HOW THE BOOTSTRAP CLASSES WORK, 
BUT BEST TO LOOK AT THE SOURCE CODE ON A PAGE LIKE AUDIO-VIDEO (HOME) 
WHICH USES JUST THE SECOND-SIDEBAR, BUT YOU'LL SEE HOW THE CLASSES ARE SET UP. THE JAVASCRIPT PLAYS OFF THE ID NAME ON THE SIDEBAR, SO THAT IS IMPORTANT TOO

    if($variables['page']['sidebar_first'] && $variables['page']['sidebar_second']) {
        $variables['offcanvas_trigger_sb'] = 'row-offcanvas-left-right';
        $variables['bsclass_main'] = 'col-xs-12 col-md-9'; // content-section
        $variables['bsclass_sb1'] = $variables['bsclass_sb2'] = 'col-xs-6 col-md-3'; // sidebar-first & sidebar-second 
    // If first side column exists
    } else if ($variables['page']['sidebar_first']) {
        $variables['offcanvas_trigger_sb'] = 'row-offcanvas-left';
        $variables['bsclass_main'] = 'col-xs-12 col-md-9'; // content-section
        $variables['bsclass_sb1'] = 'col-xs-6 col-md-3'; // sidebar-first
        $variables['bsclass_sb2'] = ''; // no sidebar
    // If second side column exists
    } else if ($variables['page']['sidebar_second']) {
        $variables['offcanvas_trigger_sb'] = 'row-offcanvas-right';
        $variables['bsclass_main'] = 'col-xs-12 col-md-9'; // content-section
        $variables['bsclass_sb1'] = ''; // no sidebar
        $variables['bsclass_sb2'] = 'col-xs-6 col-md-3'; // sidebar-second
    }
